# Regression-Metrics

📢📊  

🔍 I wanted to share some valuable insights on regression metrics and their significance in analyzing data patterns and building robust models. 📈 Whether you're a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or aspiring enthusiast, understanding regression metrics is key to unlocking powerful predictive models. Let's dive in! 💡

📝 Regression Metrics Notes in Detail: 📝

1️⃣ Mean Squared Error (MSE): 💭
MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. It gives us an idea of how well the model's predictions align with the true values. Lower MSE values indicate better accuracy.

2️⃣ Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 🌱
RMSE is the square root of MSE, providing a measure of the average prediction error. Like MSE, lower RMSE values indicate a more accurate model. RMSE is often preferred as it is in the same unit as the target variable.

3️⃣ Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 📉
MAE calculates the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. It gives an indication of the magnitude of errors in the predictions, without considering their direction. Lower MAE values indicate better accuracy.

4️⃣ R-squared (R²): 🎯
R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables in the regression model. A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

5️⃣ Adjusted R-squared: 📊
Adjusted R-squared takes into account the number of independent variables and sample size, adjusting the R-squared value accordingly. It helps in avoiding the overfitting of the model and provides a more reliable measure of model performance.

6️⃣ Mean Percentage Error (MPE): 📉
MPE calculates the average percentage difference between the predicted and actual values. It represents the average magnitude of errors as a percentage. Positive values indicate overestimation, while negative values indicate underestimation.

7️⃣ Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 📉
MAPE calculates the average absolute percentage difference between the predicted and actual values. It provides a relative measure of the magnitude of errors in the predictions. Lower MAPE values indicate better accuracy.🚀💡
